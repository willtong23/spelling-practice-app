# Function Key Protection Fix

## Problem
Users were experiencing accidental sign outs when pressing volume buttons like **F3** on some computers. The app was designed to require fresh authentication on any page refresh, so when F3 triggered a browser refresh, users would be signed out unexpectedly.

## Root Cause
- The spelling app requires fresh sign-in on every page load/refresh for security
- Some browsers interpret F3 (and other function keys) as refresh commands
- When F3 was pressed, it would trigger `window.location.reload()` or similar browser refresh
- This caused the authentication system to clear stored credentials and show the sign-in modal

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Function Key Protection System
Created comprehensive keyboard event protection that blocks:
- **F1-F12 function keys** (including F3 volume keys)
- **F5 refresh key**
- **Ctrl+R / Cmd+R refresh combinations**
- **Other browser shortcuts** that could cause navigation

### 2. Files Modified

#### `script.js` (Student App)
- Added `handleKeyboardProtection()` function in DOMContentLoaded event
- Blocks function keys F1-F12 with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- Installed at multiple event levels (document, window, capture/bubble phases)
- Logs blocked keys to console for debugging

#### `function-key-protection.js` (Standalone Protection)
- Self-executing function that provides comprehensive protection
- Blocks function keys, refresh combinations, and browser shortcuts
- Includes debugging functions and global availability check
- Loaded in both student and teacher pages

#### `index.html` (Student Page)
- Added `<script src="function-key-protection.js"></script>` inclusion
- Provides backup protection layer

### 3. Protection Features

#### Blocked Keys:
- **F1-F12**: All function keys including volume controls
- **F5**: Direct refresh key
- **Ctrl+R / Cmd+R**: Refresh key combinations
- **F11**: Fullscreen toggle
- **F12**: Developer tools
- **Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Shift+I**: Developer tools shortcuts

#### Protection Levels:
- Document-level event listeners (capture phase)
- Window-level event listeners
- Both keydown and keyup events blocked
- `preventDefault()`, `stopPropagation()`, and `stopImmediatePropagation()`

### 4. Testing
Created `test-function-keys.html` for verification:
- Visual test interface for function key protection
- Real-time logging of blocked keys
- Instructions for testing F3 and other function keys
- Confirmation that protection is working

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ‚úÖ What WILL Cause Sign Out (Intended):
1. **1-minute idle timeout** - automatic security feature
2. **Red "Sign Out" button** - intentional user action
3. **Browser refresh button** - intentional user action
4. **Manual page reload** - intentional user action

### ‚ùå What Will NOT Cause Sign Out (Fixed):
1. **F3 volume keys** - now blocked and logged
2. **Other function keys (F1-F12)** - now blocked
3. **Accidental F5 presses** - now blocked
4. **Accidental Ctrl+R** - now blocked

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Handling Strategy:
```javascript
function handleKeyboardProtection(e) {
    // Block F1-F12 function keys
    if (e.key && e.key.startsWith('F') && e.key.length <= 3) {
        const keyNumber = parseInt(e.key.substring(1));
        if (keyNumber >= 1 && keyNumber <= 12) {
            console.log(`üîí BLOCKED: Function key ${e.key}`);
            e.preventDefault();
            e.stopPropagation();
            e.stopImmediatePropagation();
            return false;
        }
    }
    // ... additional protection logic
}
```

### Multi-Level Installation:
```javascript
// Install at multiple levels for maximum coverage
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyboardProtection, true);
document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyboardProtection, true);
window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyboardProtection, true);
window.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyboardProtection, true);
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Open the spelling app** at `localhost:8029`
2. **Sign in** as a student
3. **Press F3** (volume key) - should NOT cause sign out
4. **Check browser console** - should see "üîí BLOCKED: Function key F3" message
5. **Try other function keys** - all should be blocked
6. **Use test page** at `localhost:8029/test-function-keys.html` for comprehensive testing

## Benefits

1. **Prevents accidental sign outs** from volume key usage
2. **Maintains security** - intentional sign out methods still work
3. **Better user experience** - no unexpected interruptions
4. **Comprehensive protection** - covers all function keys and refresh combinations
5. **Easy to debug** - clear console logging of blocked keys
6. **Non-intrusive** - doesn't affect normal app functionality

## Compatibility

- Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Compatible with both Windows and Mac keyboards
- Handles different keyboard layouts and function key mappings
- No impact on normal typing or app functionality

**Status: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

The F3 volume key issue has been resolved. Users can now press volume keys without accidentally signing out of the spelling practice app.
