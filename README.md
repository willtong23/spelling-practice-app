2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Update the Firebase configuration in both `index.html` and `teacher.html`

### 2. Teacher Dashboard Setup
1. Open `teacher.html` in your browser
2. Navigate through the tabs to set up your classroom:

#### Word Sets Tab

## üéØ How Assignment System Works

### Priority Order
1. **Individual Assignment**: If a student has a specific word set assigned to them
2. **Active Word Set**: If no individual assignment, uses the currently active word set
3. **Legacy Compatibility**: Falls back to the old wordlist format
4. **Default Words**: Uses built-in default words as final fallback

### Assignment Flow
1. Teacher creates word sets in the dashboard
2. Teacher adds students and organizes them into classes
3. Teacher assigns word sets to students or classes
4. When a student opens the practice app:
   - App looks up the student by name
   - Finds their current assignment
   - Loads the appropriate word set
   - Student practices with their assigned words

## üìä Analytics & Reporting

### Student Performance Tracking

4. **Backup Data**: Regularly export important data

### For Students
1. **Use Headphones**: For better audio experience
